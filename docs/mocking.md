# API mocking of the next generation

At TN we use [Mock Service Worker](https://mswjs.io/) to intercept requests on the network level.
Seamlessly reuse the same mock definition for testing, development, and debugging.

## Why Mock Service Worker?

- Interception on the network level
- Composable functional syntax
- Standardized Service Worker API
- Client-side execution
- Support of REST API and GraphQL
- Native TypeScript support
